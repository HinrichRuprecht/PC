img is the directory for images of the symbols used in the PC (playing cards) 
project.
File names are "I<hex>-<color>.png', where <hex> is the utf hex code for the 
symbol, and <color> stands for the card colors (0..3) plus some others:
    0=spades=black
    1=hearts=red
    2=diamonds=orange
    3=clubs=green
    4=blue
    6=yellow
    7=silver
    
The images were created using Perl image package. They usually show the same as the 
browser displaying the utf code.
